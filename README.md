## GitHub Search Application

Android Application to track any user search activity on Github  using the Github Developers Api. A sample application to demonstrate how to use Jetpack Architecture Components in an Android Application following the Clean MVVM Architecture concepts.

## ‚öô Tech used
- Github Api
- Kotlin
- Model-View-Viewmodel Architecture
- Navigation component
- Room database
- Retrofit 2
- GSON
- Moshi
- Kotlin Courtines.
- Glide.
-Data-Binding.
-SQL-queries.

This app demonstrates the following views and techniques from the below documentation.

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make api calls to an HTTP web service.
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) which handles the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects. 
* [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) to load and cache images by URL.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for local database storage.
  
It leverages the following components from the Jetpack library:

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) with binding adapters
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments
